# iot_app

An IOT app for weather monitoring

## Getting Started
Scaffold: Providing overall structure to the app

SafeArea: Displays widgets inside the SafeArea in places not obscured by system ui and notches.

Center: Centers all widgets both horizontally and vertically which are inside it.

SizedBox: The SizedBox widget is used to add vertical space between the widgets.

SingleChildScrollView: It is a widget that allows its child to be scrolled vertically. 
It's particularly useful when you have a single widget that is larger than the viewport and you want to make it scrollable.
Also prevents the overflow error when selecting on screen keyboard.

@override : When you use @override, the Dart compiler checks if the method marked with @override is indeed overriding a method from a superclass. 
If it's not, the compiler generates an error, alerting you to potential mistakes in your code.
